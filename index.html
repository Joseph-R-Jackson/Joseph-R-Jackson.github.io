            <li>I'm active. I wrestled all throughout highschool; currently I weight lift and practice combat sports.</li>
            <li>Recently, I've been getting into competitive programming. The process of solving problems is exciting, and solving problems you struggled with is gratifying.</li>
            <li>Currently I'm an active member at Intervarsity.</li>
            <li>I spend a good chunk of my time absorbed in School work. Academia is important to me; which is why I currently have a 4.0.</li>

        <h1>Work History</h1>
        <p>I worked as a Data Specialist at ATL technologies for around 6 months.
            my team primarily worked on switching the companies database to infor, 
            data mining, and getting company employees use to Infor. I got this job shortly after
            graduating highschool, and it inspired me to pursue Computer Science as a career.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python, Infor, Sql Server, Miscrosoft Excel, VBA, Regex.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Movie Database</h2>
            <p>
                This project was backend heavy, and used DOM manipulation to
                edit a form where users could enter movie data. I also went the
                extra mile in terms of styling.

            <h2>Multiplying Logical Matrices</h2>
            <p>
                This project was a satisfying one. When I realized I could use a helper
                function to rotate my matrix 90 degrees, to aid in multiplying, I was happy.
                This project showcases an ability to problem solve, and knowledge in python.

        <div id="perm-proj">
        <h2>Permutations and Combinations</h2>
        <p>
            This project was fun because of how quickly the number of perms/combs grow.
            This project displays understanding of a fundamental element of math needed for programming.
